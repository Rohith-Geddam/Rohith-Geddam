## About Me

I'm a mechanical engineering graduate currently working as a **Technical Assistant — Associate Consulting at Hitachi Vantara**, where I've developed a deep expertise in data analytics, machine learning, and enterprise AI systems. My transition from mechanical engineering to data science is fueled by a passion for solving complex problems through data and AI.

**What I bring to the table:**
- **AI & LLM Integration**: Multi-agent systems, prompt engineering, LangChain orchestration
- **Data Science & Analytics**: Predictive modeling, feature engineering, business intelligence
- **Software Engineering**: Clean Python code, scalable architectures, production-ready systems
- **Domain Knowledge**: Engineering mindset + data-driven problem solving
- **Enterprise Experience**: Building solutions for real business problems, not just Kaggle competitions

**Currently exploring:** Multi-agent AI systems, advanced prompt engineering, cloud deployment, and generative AI applications.

## Featured Projects

### 1. **Employee Burnout Detection & Prevention Agent**
*Multi-Agent Enterprise AI System | LLM + Data Science + Business Intelligence*

A sophisticated enterprise system that detects employee burnout risk using machine learning, generates personalized interventions via LLMs, and provides actionable HR insights.

- **What it does:** Analyzes 9+ employee wellness indicators → predicts burnout risk (85-92% accuracy) → generates personalized messages for employees, HR, and managers → interactive dashboard for decision-making
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, LangChain, Google Generative AI, Plotly, Streamlit
- **Key Achievement:** Identified 47% of employees at risk and recommended 300+ targeted interventions
- **[View on Kaggle →](https://www.kaggle.com/code/roge29/employee-burnout-agent)**

**Why this project matters:** Shows I can build end-to-end AI solutions that go beyond modeling—from data engineering → ML → LLM integration → business insights → user interface.
